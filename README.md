"# Key-Logger" 


This is a keylogger script that captures real-time keystrokes and automatically sends the logs via email for easy tracking.

üîç How it works:

The script runs in the background by hiding the console window (on Windows) to remain undetected.

It uses the keyboard module to capture every keystroke and stores them in a buffer.

When the "Enter" key is pressed, the captured keystrokes are sent via secure email using Gmail's SMTP service (via port 587 and STARTTLS encryption).

If the "Escape" key is pressed, the program stops logging and exits.

Final logs are saved to a text file before the program exits, just in case the script is interrupted unexpectedly.

üîê Why this project?

This was a great opportunity to dive deeper into system-level programming and email protocols in Python. I got hands-on experience with concepts like handling keyboard events, email automation, and interacting with operating system libraries to hide processes.

Defending Against Keyloggers and Similar Threats:

How to Prevent Keylogger Threats: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-life-hacks/privacy-and-safety/what-is-a-keylogger

1- Endpoint Protection:

Implementing antivirus and anti-malware solutions across all endpoints is the first line of defense. These tools can detect and block known keyloggers and malicious software before they can execute.

Regularly update endpoint security software to ensure it recognizes the latest threats, as keyloggers and malware often evolve.

2- User Awareness and Training:

Conduct regular security awareness training for all employees to recognize phishing emails and suspicious downloads, as many keyloggers are delivered through malicious attachments or links.

Best practices such as using strong passwords and enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) can reduce the likelihood of successful attacks.

3- Network Security:

Implementing firewalls and intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to monitor and block unauthorized communication from compromised devices can help prevent keyloggers from transmitting data.

Use network segmentation to limit lateral movement within the network if a device is compromised.

4- Behavioral Monitoring and Detection:

Real-time monitoring of system and network behavior using SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems can help identify abnormal activities, such as unusual keylogging activity or unexpected network traffic (e.g., emails sent from internal machines to external addresses).

Monitoring for anomalous keystroke patterns or unexpected processes can be a signal that a keylogger is running.

5- Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):

Using EDR solutions enables continuous monitoring of endpoint activities, helping to quickly detect and respond to keyloggers by identifying suspicious processes or unauthorized software installations.

EDR tools can also offer detailed visibility into the attack lifecycle, allowing security teams to understand how the keylogger entered the network and how to mitigate the impact.

6- Access Control and Privilege Management:

Least privilege should be enforced for user accounts. By limiting user permissions, you reduce the likelihood of malicious software being able to install itself or steal sensitive data.

Regularly audit user access and remove any unnecessary privileges or inactive accounts that could become potential targets.

7- Regular Security Audits and Updates:

Perform regular security audits to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by keyloggers. This includes patching operating systems, applications, and security software.

Zero-day exploits used by keyloggers can be mitigated by keeping systems up to date and applying patches as soon as they are released.

8- Email Filtering and Anti-Spam Solutions:

Keyloggers often arrive through phishing emails, so using email filtering solutions can block malicious attachments or links before they reach the user.

Spam filters and URL scanning in emails can also detect and neutralize threats before they are opened.

9 - Incident Response Plan:

Having a well-defined incident response plan in place is crucial for quickly isolating and containing keylogger infections. The plan should outline how to identify, contain, and remediate attacks, including notifying affected users and restoring systems to a clean state.
